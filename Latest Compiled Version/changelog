Build 347 2014-02-27:
 - Fixed: Old formwat for the disclaimer was still partially used by accident, doesn't really have a big effect, as it's converted on each boot untill you disable the disclaimer...
Build 346 2014-02-27:
 - Fixed: Crash when using the new version for the first time, and some errors with the Disclaimer disablement stuff... didn't always work quite as it should...
 - Added: Crash log will now also reflect the version used...
 - Added: New check type (Data Matches) This type checks for areas of the NAND/NOR which should be the same at specified offsets, such as bootldr size (they should always be a match) and per console nonce
 - Fixed: Check count is now correct (each part of the repetition check is a different check, so it should be counted as such...)
Build 344 2014-02-25:
 - Added: You can now disable the disclaimer that pops up during startup from the settings menu, it has always been possible by editing the registry manually or pressing Ctrl + F1...
Build 343 2014-02-25:
 - Fixed: Loading "patch.bin" now works properly...
 - Added: When repetitions are failing you'll be told what address line(s) to check in order to solve the problem
   - NOTE: The feature have been tested properly now... and... If A0 is bad the whole image will look REALLY bad... there is no way i can reliably check for this error atm (repetitions don't happen because the check size is too big)
Build 342 2014-02-25:
 - Fixed: Wording in settings (I originally added 3.55 patching as an option, but spoke to rogero and he explained that his 4.55 works the same way with better compatibility for newer consoles, and also with the noFSM...)
Build 341 2014-02-25:
 - Added: Option to use internal patcher (Currently included patches are Rogero's 4.55 Patches, they support ALL methods of downgrading [FactoryServiceMode and "NoFSM" CFW install])
   - NOTE: This will be disabled for metldr2 dumps...
   - NOTE: The embedded patches can be overridden by placing a new one as "patch.bin" next to the exe...
 - Added: Version check for the application update check
 - Fixed: Better error handling when checking for updates, and moved the code to check for cfg/hashlist updates to form load instead (allowing for it to load first so you know it haven't crashed...)
 - Added: You'll now be notified if you're already using the latest hashlist/cfg when doing a manual update check
 - Added: There's now a tool to fix problems with NOR dumps that were made with address lines swapped by accident... you can access it by pressing Ctrl + F9 (Thanks goes to Judges for the code snippet to do this! :D)
   - NOTE: This was added as a way for me to simulate errors, thus the name of it "Simulate Shit" xD There's also a tool to edit a dump to simulate a bad address line... (not useful for most of you ;))
 - Changed: The changelog now uses the font "Consolas" to make sure the formatting is the same as when i write it in Visual Studio :)
Build 338 2014-02-20:
 - Changed: Better error handler, it'll now show you where it saves the crash log and also save it next to the exe instead...
 - Fixed: Downloading the hashlist/config now properly checks default.cfg/default.hashlist before downloading and not latest.cfg/latest.hashlist
Build 337 2014-02-20:
 - Added: Error handler for a different type of crash which only effected some users (dafuq?)
 - Fixed: Hopefully fixed the crash some of you experienced with the previous builds (325 & 332 atleast)
Build 332 2014-02-20:
 - Added: Button/Icon for Settings
 - Added: Repetitions check (look for data that should only exist once...) [ Enabled by default]
 - Fixed: Hash checking of the app is now done correctly :)
Build 325 2014-02-17:
 - Fixed: Error beeing shown while checking for app updates then the file beeing downloaded anyways... maybe i need more sleep?
Build 323 2014-02-17:
 - Fixed: AutoDLHashlist now downloads the hashlist and not the cfg (woops!)
 - Added: Before downloading any file an attempt will be made to check if the current file is the same as the online one, if it is... then it'll be ignored...
Build 322 2014-02-17:
 - Fixed: The app can now properly download itself from github (my bad!)
Build 319 2014-02-17:
 - Added: Auto download the latest hashlist/cfg automatically on load
 - Changed: Now using Github as the update server instead... (easier for me to maintain)
 - Updated: The embedded cfg/hashlist are updated as all other builds before (to the latest one today)
 - Removed: I've removed the TRVK_PRG# and TRVK_PKG# hashes from the list, they're quite useless anyways ;)
Build 305 2013-08-20:
 - Added: Upon getting a smaller screen height of 600 pixels it'll now resize the window to fit...
Build 304 2013-08-12:
 - Added disclaimer message everytime you launch it, to disable that hit Ctrl + F1
 - Fixed an issue with the hashchecks and added a new hash (Thanks to BwE's tool, it was identified as 3.66 so i added it ;)) there'll be many more to add later on...
 - Fixed a typo in the CFG for identifying CECHJxx (DIA-002) datecode: 8B
Build 299 2013-08-08:
 - Added Settings menu (Ctrl + F12)
 - Added A Way for you to bypass the HashCheck (if you don't want it, just disable it!)
 - Updates are now completed, the app will now update itself on request...
Build 282 - 2013-08-07:
 - Added Hash checks for:
   - ROS0
   - ROS1
   - TRVK_PRG0
   - TRVK_PRG1
   - TRVK_PKG0
   - TRVK_PKG1
 - Fixed a couple of bugs
 - Added The inital Internet Updates function (somewhat broken)
Build 252 - 2013-07-29: 
 - Fixed a bug caused by computers completing checks faster then it could process the checks list
Build 250 - 2013-07-26:
 - Added Auto Launching Rogero's Patcher if present and dump verified...
 - Removed statistics check from the default cfg (they're rarely ever passing anyways unless 3.55 patched first)
